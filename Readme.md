# Tamil Wordle

Tamil Wordle is a word-guessing game based on the popular game Wordle, but specifically designed for the Tamil language. The game provides a fun and easy way to learn Tamil while trying to guess the hidden word.

## How to Play

1. Visit the game website at [tamilwordle.in](https://www.tamilwordle.in).
2. The game presents you with a hidden Tamil word.
3. Guess the word by entering a five-letter combination.
4. After each guess, the game provides feedback to indicate which letters are correct and in the correct position (highlighted in green), and which letters are correct but in the wrong position (highlighted in yellow).
5. Use the feedback to make educated guesses and try to guess the word correctly within five tries.
6. A new puzzle is available every day, so come back daily to test your Tamil vocabulary skills.
